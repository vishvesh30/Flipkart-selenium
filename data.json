I placed the order on 25th April, got it delivered on 2nd May and installation completed on 6th May.\n\nBefore I placed my order, I enquired at different offline outlets such as Vijay Sales, Croma and other big showrooms. I was given misleading information by almost all of them. Flipkart also arranged the installation and those technicians told me that they used to work at Croma earlier and they knew how Croma gives wrong technical information to maximise their profit.\n\nWhen I enquired at Croma, they told me avoid copper tube as it is not advisable for cities located near seashore. The flipkart technicians strongly rejected this ideology and insisted that Copper tube is much more durable than aluminium tube and can be repaired ifn case of issues. Aluminium has no option but replacement. Ususally, these issues will come up after the warranty period is expired and then it becomes chargeable.\n\nI booked through flipkart App and got 2 discount offers. As a result, I paid Rs. 23,990/- for each AC and approx. Rs. 1100/- for installation. The offline cost was more than Rs. 32,000/- for similar model. I strongly suggest encourage everyone to make online shopping for AC- after duly verifying offline market cost and technical specifications.\n\nThe important points are- tonnage, power consumption, star rating, copper/aluminium tube, warranty and installation charges.\n\nOnce you purchase, register it immediately on the brand company's website. I faced a small problem after 1 month but flipkart did not provide any support because they have only 30 days replacement guarantee. They suggested me to inform Voltas and then Voltas sent their engineer and the issue was resolved."}, {"Name": "Voltas 1.5 Ton 5 Star BEE Rating 2017 Split AC - White  (185JY, Aluminium Condenser)", "Review_title": "Mixed Feelings !", "Review_text": "the product itself is good(Copper) and I got it at 27ks during an offer period.

Had a very bad experience with the person who came for the installation. Fortunately had read bad reviews about Jeeves already hence was not fooled by them and completely dont understand how they still are in the system even after so many bad reviews and complaints. Here's how the entire thing goes.\nJeeves customer care calls me and informs me that the installation can be done today itself (on the date of delivery) and then i receive a call from the service engineer who states that he would require a site visit to understand what all materials would be required to do the installation on which i agreed.\nPerson comes to my place. Check the entire thing and consistently tries to manupulate me to increase the distance between the indoor and outdoor unit so that an addition copper tube sale can be made (INR 250/ft) on which i dint agree and asked him to do the placements of both units according to me which eventually turned out to be of no extra cost and can be done with the stock tube which came with the units.\nSecondly he says that the rubber / silicon hos used to as a water outlet would habe to be bought which would be for INR 300 for 4 ft, dont knw how a generic water hose 4ft long can be for 300.\nI agreed to all the same and asked him what and when can all this be done so that i can compare his prices with the market price before fixing him for my installation. Total charge stated by jeeves came up to INR 3550 which i said ki ill give a call and confirm if this has to be done or not .\nAt the time of leaving the person says \"So you give me Rs 750 now and ill get the stand when i come next time\" on which i said that ill pay once the installation is done and not before that on which in a second he replied \" Sir you have to give me Rs 500 atleast now for the site visit\".\n@Jeeves : Why do i have to pay you 500 for just coming till my place and checking out what all is required. You have sent me 3 Sms's, 2 Calls and 1 Mail and nowhere is this mentioned then why does the service engineer ask for INR500/ site visit.\nI refused on paying a single penny to him and am not going to get my ac installed by Jeeves at all. I have searched and have got people who can do the entire would in less than INR 2000.\nTo top all this at the time of leaving the guy says \"If everyone keeps doing this then how would we earn\"\n@Flipkart : You seriously need to do something about them else you are surely loosing customers."}, {"Name": "Voltas 1.2 Ton 5 Star BEE Rating 2017 Split AC - White  (155CY, Aluminium Condenser)", "Review_title": "Worth the money", "Review_text": "AC works Fine.

Perfectly packed and delivered without any hassles at lightning pace.\n\nProduct : I already have a Hitachi 5 star A/C which I have been using for 3 years now, I haven't had any issues, so the brand is very reliable. Even with this one so far I haven't had any complaints, it's quiet and does the job well. I have added a VG 400 V Guard stabilizer to protect from any voltage fluctuations - Stabilizer is a must to safeguard your appliance.\n\nInstallation by Hitachi : This is where I had to rate low (I wanted to rate this 3 but 3 star reviews don't show up in search by default, you have to click on show ALL, I want the buying community to read this review, I didn't invest time to explain the whole process so Flipkart can conveniently keep my review under the rug ) since it would be unfair if I just rate a product with based on delivery experience, the product was delivered on May 26 and Hitachi installed it on May 6 after multiple visits to my house.\n\nFirst visit from Hitachi - Technician says, outdoor unit for this model is a bit noisy (it's not noisy or super quiet, it's acceptable), yes you guessed it right, Hitachi technician came for installation said that, surprising they don't even back their products. They analysed the hole allotted for A/C in our apartment and said the bore was not good enough, so it needs other technicians to fix the bore, they might charge 2000 rupees or more to increase the bore diameter and left.\n\nSecond visit : Technicians that visited were not informed that this is for new installation, so they were caught by surprise and left since they don't not specialize in installation.\n\nI called flipkart in the middle and raised a concern about additional charges, I had to talk to a supervisor since the customer rep that I initially talked to couldn't understand or comprehend the problem or provide a better resolution. Supervisor seemed like a sensible person, he assured that there won't be any additional charges, flipkart scores better again for service here.\n\nThird Visit : Supervisors or other technicians from Hitachi visited and they assured that charges would be standard - installation (501 flipkart offer) + brackets (900) and left without doing any work.\n\nFourth/Final Visit : A/C was installed and it's is working fine now. Charges 1800 Rupees (501 + 900 + 400 (to increase the bore diameter)). My sister switched off the A/C after the demo and water started leaking from the indoor unit, the technicians immediately fixed it, now it's all good. But let the A/C run and switch off to verify all looks good before you bid bye to Hitachi technician. As you can see here, you don't want to call/deal with them again. It's not that exciting.\n\nIf Flipkart can work with Hitachi and ensure smooth installation, one can buy with confidence. Again this is just one off incident and it took 6 days more than the promised installation date of 29 May, which is not bad but I don't want people visiting my flat multiple times.\n\nGeneral comment - product demo/installation - technicians need to address who they are and why they are visiting while they visit, we cannot assume someone to be a Hitachi tech based on their uniform.

Took almost 3 hours for the installation.\n\nSome of the features worth mentioning:\niConnect Series:\nConnect with wi-fi, you can control the AC with your android/iPhone through wi-fi,\nAC has its own hotspot or you can configure the AC to connect with your wi-fi router, either will be active at a time.\nIts more easy to control through your mobile than the remote.\nIt works even over the internet if configured with your wi-fi router.

And I am still doubtful if he has installed the AC properly.\nI fixed the vibration by installing rubber pads on all the 4 points where ODU is screwed.

Perfectly packed and delivered without any hassles at lightning pace.\n\nProduct : I already have a Hitachi 5 star A/C which I have been using for 3 years now, I haven't had any issues, so the brand is very reliable. Even with this one so far I haven't had any complaints, it's quiet and does the job well. I have added a VG 400 V Guard stabilizer to protect from any voltage fluctuations - Stabilizer is a must to safeguard your appliance.\n\nInstallation by Hitachi : This is where I had to rate low (I wanted to rate this 3 but 3 star reviews don't show up in search by default, you have to click on show ALL, I want the buying community to read this review, I didn't invest time to explain the whole process so Flipkart can conveniently keep my review under the rug ) since it would be unfair if I just rate a product with based on delivery experience, the product was delivered on May 26 and Hitachi installed it on May 6 after multiple visits to my house.\n\nFirst visit from Hitachi - Technician says, outdoor unit for this model is a bit noisy (it's not noisy or super quiet, it's acceptable), yes you guessed it right, Hitachi technician came for installation said that, surprising they don't even back their products. They analysed the hole allotted for A/C in our apartment and said the bore was not good enough, so it needs other technicians to fix the bore, they might charge 2000 rupees or more to increase the bore diameter and left.\n\nSecond visit : Technicians that visited were not informed that this is for new installation, so they were caught by surprise and left since they don't not specialize in installation.\n\nI called flipkart in the middle and raised a concern about additional charges, I had to talk to a supervisor since the customer rep that I initially talked to couldn't understand or comprehend the problem or provide a better resolution. Supervisor seemed like a sensible person, he assured that there won't be any additional charges, flipkart scores better again for service here.\n\nThird Visit : Supervisors or other technicians from Hitachi visited and they assured that charges would be standard - installation (501 flipkart offer) + brackets (900) and left without doing any work.\n\nFourth/Final Visit : A/C was installed and it's is working fine now. Charges 1800 Rupees (501 + 900 + 400 (to increase the bore diameter)). My sister switched off the A/C after the demo and water started leaking from the indoor unit, the technicians immediately fixed it, now it's all good. But let the A/C run and switch off to verify all looks good before you bid bye to Hitachi technician. As you can see here, you don't want to call/deal with them again. It's not that exciting.\n\nIf Flipkart can work with Hitachi and ensure smooth installation, one can buy with confidence. Again this is just one off incident and it took 6 days more than the promised installation date of 29 May, which is not bad but I don't want people visiting my flat multiple times.\n\nGeneral comment - product demo/installation - technicians need to address who they are and why they are visiting while they visit, we cannot assume someone to be a Hitachi tech based on their uniform.

The insulation of the AC pipes was cut short by the Hitachi \"engineer\". That left a 6 inch gap on the both the pipes on the outdoor unit side. That reduced cooling.
